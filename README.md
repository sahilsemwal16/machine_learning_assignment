Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict tipping behavior in restaurants based on customer billing and demographic details. Using machine learning regression techniques, this analysis will help restaurants tailor services and optimize operations for improved customer service and revenue management.

Objectives
Identify Influential Factors: Analyze which factors significantly impact tip amounts.
Predictive Modeling: Develop and evaluate models to accurately forecast tip amounts.
Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations to improve customer service and operational strategies based on tipping behavior analysis.
Methods
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Scatter Plot: Visualize relationships between individual predictors and tip amounts.
Pair Plot: Examine correlations among multiple features.
Correlation Matrix (Heatmap): Identify key variables impacting tip amounts.
Rainbow Test: Perform statistical tests to verify linearity assumptions.
Residuals Plot: Assess fit quality for linear models.
Line Plot: Analyze time series trends (if applicable).
Regression Techniques:

Linear Regression
Ridge & Lasso Regularization
Decision Tree Regression
Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest)
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model Evaluation: Use error metrics to compare model accuracy and select the best-fit regression model.
